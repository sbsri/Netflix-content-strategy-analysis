Objective:
To analyze Netflix’s content strategy with a focus on how it leverages data, original content, and global market expansion to maintain competitive advantage and user engagement.

Background:
Netflix has evolved from a DVD rental service to the world’s leading subscription-based streaming platform. Central to this transformation is a content strategy that is both dynamic and highly adaptive to audience behavior and market trends.

Research Focus Areas:
Data-Driven Content Curation:

Netflix utilizes predictive analytics and user behavior data to inform decisions on content acquisition and production.

Personalized recommendation algorithms account for over 75% of the content viewed, emphasizing the importance of data in content discovery.

Original Content Development:

Since launching its first original series (House of Cards, 2013), Netflix has significantly scaled its in-house content production.

Investment in original content (over $17B in recent years) helps reduce reliance on licensed content and strengthens brand identity.

Localization and Global Reach:

Netflix produces region-specific content in local languages (e.g., Sacred Games in India, Lupin in France) to penetrate international markets.

Its global platform enables cross-border content success, allowing local productions to gain international recognition.

Genre and Format Diversification:

The platform offers a wide array of content across genres and formats (films, series, documentaries, anime, stand-up, reality TV).

This diversification ensures broader demographic reach and caters to varied audience preferences.

Content Release Strategies:

Pioneered the "binge-watch" model by releasing full seasons simultaneously.

Recently, experimenting with staggered releases to increase anticipation and reduce churn.

Strategic Partnerships and Licensing:

While reducing dependency on licensed content, Netflix still engages in strategic licensing deals to fill genre gaps or capitalize on trending topics.

Expected Outcomes:
Understanding how content strategy supports Netflix’s user retention and market growth.

Identifying challenges Netflix faces from competitors adopting similar models.

Assessing the sustainability of its high-content spending model.
